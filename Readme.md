# Getting Started:

This project enables the processing of Covid-19 news by providing user input. News text is parsed to obtain meaningful datasets. This data is reported in graphical format.

This project has been developed and tested using the following tools and versions:

## Local Development Environment Configuration

| Technology     | Host        | Port  | Description                 |
|----------------|-------------|-------|-----------------------------|

> Tip: I added the test data I used locally to the "Test Dataset" folder. It can be used as the base data for the charts in the React interface. If you want to use it, you can import it directly into the database using MongoDB Compass.
